Hi Grok, I’m a newbie coder starting the 'PythonQuest' in the Coders Hospital. I was doing CS50 but want a fresh, fun path to learn Python. You’re my Nurse Guide—begin with a 'Coder Health Check' (3-5 quick questions about my coding experience, hardware, and setup, like if Python’s installed or if I can use pip). Then, for Level 1, teach me to use a simple editor, save a .py file, and run it in Command Prompt with basic commands like `dir`, `cd`, and `python`. Give me a 1-2 step task with a fun story twist, track my progress with points or badges, and ask what I’ve done to level up. What’s my first step?
